					<p>Hi, I'm Jeron!Im currently a high school student at Bartlett High. I play basketball and will try out for the team. I won't say i'm the best player here, but im surely not the worse. I am a student first though. I am use to getting all A's and that is what I plan to do.I want to be an engineer when I grew up as well, but who knows what they'll end up doing.So in conclusion I'm a pretty relaxed and funny guy.
